              “For longer than recorded history, humans have been devoted to an
              unquenchable desire to divine truth about the world around us:
              systems and forces that operate just beyond the reach of our
              control. This scenario is the wellspring of our cultural
              development, often coalescing across multiple domains of art,
              science, technology, and religion. The digital world provides
              boundless tools to simulate systems and forces, natural and
              imagined, with a high degree of fidelity. As with ancient tribal
              fires, we gather around the flickering pixels and voxels, drawing
              forth and projecting equal parts fascination and imagination.
            </p>
            <p>
              ‘Polynomial Divination’ is a meditation on this long-held
              dimension of human creativity and exploration – relying on a blend
              of computer-based rendering and a custom projection/lighting
              system.”

            We designed a virtual fire that follows and attracts individuals
            nearby. We positioned this installation in the centre of other
            artworks, creating a gathering spot for people to congregate. This
            concept pays homage to the time-honoured tradition of gathering
            around a hearth to share stories but with a futuristic twist.

            We utilized TouchDesigner to create the flame and incorporated
            ultrasonic sensors along the sides of the container. My role
            involved embedding and integrating the sensors and their data into
            the simulation, allowing it to respond and be "attracted" to people.
