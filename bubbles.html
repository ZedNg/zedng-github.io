                        "Bubbles" is a set of sonic arts experiments to produce
                        an ambient soundtrack and a visual experience using
                        sounds made from field recordings. The sounds I used
                        were captured from my daily life and modulated used
                        Adobe Audition to master the piece.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The soundtrack aims to produce a feeling of wonder with
                        a sense of uncertainty and anxiety. Bubbles float freely
                        in the air and creating different visual effects with
                        lights from the surrounding. However, bubbles also have
                        a fragile existence and pop without warning.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It is meant to serve as an analogy about life. We move
                        and live freely, and sometimes aimlessly, during our
                        lifetime where we enjoy our freedom and interact with
                        our environment. But also like a bubble, life does come
                        abruptly to an end. It is something I find people should
                        keep in mind.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Another reason for the name is that there is no angry
                        way to say the word “Bubbles”.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        From the soundtrack, I produced “Bubbles No. 0”. It is a
                        prelude of the track “Bubbles”. It consists of audio
                        elements used in "Bubbles" and rearranged to provide a
                        short rendition of the original piece.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Visually, this piece is an exploration of using bright
                        and highly contrasting colours and simple shapes to
                        create fascinating visuals. Also, the effects of the
                        visual elements were generated and controlled by the
                        computer’s interpretation of the audio track.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The visual echoes the feeling of wonder with a sense of
                        uncertainty and anxiety created by the soundtrack. The
                        unnatural movement of the bubbles, the flashy colours
                        and the odd patterns produced an unreal atmosphere and
                        enhanced the anxious feeling.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The hyper-realistic rendering also created an uncanny
                        valley situation and made the whole video look like a
                        psychedelic illusion, which is what life feels like
                        sometimes.
                    </p>
