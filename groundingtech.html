                    <p>
                        I have a personal relationship and understanding of
                        mental health and the pains and helplessness caused by
                        it. Mental health is a topic that is still rather
                        “tabooed”. People feel uncomfortable talking about it
                        openly and avoid seeking help. Anxiety attacks are often
                        silence and people tend to hide their problems. These
                        will add up to their mental stress and may even cause
                        people to react destructively.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The animation is a guide to doing a grounding technique
                        for anxiety attacks, which primarily serve as a
                        self-help aid. In the long term, I expect it to also
                        serve as a reminder that help is out there and as a
                        starting point for people to get help.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The animation is aimed at a general public, the planned
                        broadcast of this animation is as an advertisement on
                        television, theatres, and online videos. The animation
                        can be reformatted to be placed on social media
                        platforms such as Instagram and Facebook.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We were asked to attach our animation to an existing
                        entity as an imaginary client for the project, I have
                        chosen the Mental Health Foundation (MHF) of New
                        Zealand, which is a charitable trust that promotes and
                        advocate mental health and wellbeing in New Zealand.
                        They often set up campaigns and services to aid people
                        in New Zealand with their mental health needs.

                        The visual focus will be the use of animated icons and
                        the colour scheme will be solid colours. The idea of
                        using icons and solid colours is similar to the “All
                        Right” campaign that Mental Health Foundation of New
                        Zealand is currently collaborating with the Canterbury
                        District Health Board. The reason to use a similar
                        visual language is to keep the messages and style
                        consistent. The animation is also related to the various
                        messages that have been produced by the campaign.

                        The graphics will be created on the computer using
                        illustration software. However, jitter effects will be
                        added to the linework to create “rustic” frame-by-frame
                        animation feel.
