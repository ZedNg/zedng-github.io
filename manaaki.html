                    <p>The objective of the brief is to create a video remix of using <a href="https://digitalnz.org/"
                            target="_blank"></a>DigitalNZ</a>'s audio-visual collections to tell and create a narrative.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The remix follows a central narration on conservation in New Zealand and its value on “Manaaki”.
                        It shows how New Zealand has been doing its part for the conservation of the environment since a
                        long time ago and why that is important for the past and future.</p>
                    <p>
                        The narration, done by the Department of Conservation, is very comfortably paced and the voice
                        of the narrator is very soothing which allowed listeners to get into the story even without any
                        images. Thus, I decided to take the cues for time and rhythm from the narration. </p>
                    <p>
                        The remix took footages from thirteen different videos, two images and three audio sources. It
                        was a great challenge to scan through all these footages to find different bits and pieces that
                        are appropriate for the message for the remix. Thanks to the vast size of the Digital NZ
                        archive, I was able to find these footages.</p>
                    <p>
                        I did not want to use too much fancy transition in the video to distract the viewers from the
                        story; hence most of the footages are simply linked with jump cuts and match cut, which also
                        allowed me to show the relationship and similarity in actions despite the difference in time and
                        space.</p>
                    <p>
                        The only heavily edited part is the beginning of the remix where the images turn from the old
                        black and white 4:3 aspect ratio low-quality video to colour and then to a modern 16:9
                        high-quality video. I did this to establish and introduce to the viewers that this remix will
                        take them through time. Another transition effect used is when I matched the actions of the
                        hikers from the present to the past, and I used an additive dissolve to blend the coloured
                        footage into the black and white footages.
