                    <p>The objective of the brief is to create a short video representing a mood.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The mood I am depicting is of “Serenity”. The Oxford English Dictionary defined it as “The state of being calm, peaceful, and untroubled.”</p>
                    <p>
                        I wanted to link the feeling of serenity back to a generic person so the viewer can relate and put themselves into the mood of the video. Thus, only an eye is featured in the video representing the protagonist.</p>
                    <p>
                        To accentuate the feeling of serenity, the video started with elements of tension such as eye movement and shot of water dripping. This creates a contrast to serenity and provides a baseline for the emotion. The eye movement also suggests that there is something more towards the images and add more details to the storytelling.</p>
                    <p>
                        The sequence is constructed in a way that is more "emotion-linear", starting with tension and ending with serenity and showing the character's relief. The colour palette chosen for this is blue and purple tones, which provide calming and soothing feeling according to colour psychology. The colours also offer a sense of uncertainty and “unrealness” to the images, allowing for a more open interpretation of the video.</p>
